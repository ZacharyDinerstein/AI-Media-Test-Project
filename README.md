# AI-Media-Test-Project
Responsive Website Mockup for AI Media

<a href="https://zacharydinerstein.github.io/AI-Media-Test-Project/" target="_blank" >VISIT SITE</a>

This project was built as the challenge portion of an interview I had with AI Media. The assignment was to reproduce a still image online and to make the site responsive. Though fairly straight forward, I liked how this page turned out, and decided to include it on Gather as a portfolio piece.
